  ### Options in all KasmVNC based GUI containers

  This container is based on [Docker Baseimage KasmVNC](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-kasmvnc) which means there are additional environment variables and run configurations to enable or disable specific functionality.

  #### Optional environment variables

  | Variable | Description |
  | :----: | --- |
  | CUSTOM_PORT | Internal port the container listens on for http if it needs to be swapped from the default 3000. |
  | CUSTOM_HTTPS_PORT | Internal port the container listens on for https if it needs to be swapped from the default 3001. |
  | CUSTOM_USER | HTTP Basic auth username, abc is default. |
  | PASSWORD | HTTP Basic auth password, abc is default. If unset there will be no auth |
  | SUBFOLDER | Subfolder for the application if running a subfolder reverse proxy, need both slashes IE `/subfolder/` |
  | TITLE | The page title displayed on the web browser, default "KasmVNC Client". |
  | FM_HOME | This is the home directory (landing) for the file manager, default "/config". |
  | START_DOCKER | If set to false a container with privilege will not automatically start the DinD Docker setup. |
  | DRINODE | If mounting in /dev/dri for [DRI3 GPU Acceleration](https://www.kasmweb.com/kasmvnc/docs/master/gpu_acceleration.html) allows you to specify the device to use IE `/dev/dri/renderD128` |

  #### Optional run configurations

  | Variable | Description |
  | :----: | --- |
  | `--privileged` | Will start a Docker in Docker (DinD) setup inside the container to use docker in an isolated environment. For increased performance mount the Docker directory inside the container to the host IE `-v /home/user/docker-data:/var/lib/docker`. |
  | `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` | Mount in the host level Docker socket to either interact with it via CLI or use Docker enabled applications. |
  | `--device /dev/dri:/dev/dri` | Mount a GPU into the container, this can be used in conjunction with the `DRINODE` environment variable to leverage a host video card for GPU accelerated appplications. Only **Open Source** drivers are supported IE (Intel,AMDGPU,Radeon,ATI,Nouveau) |

  ### Lossless mode

  This container is capable of delivering a true lossless image at a high framerate to your web browser by changing the Stream Quality preset to "Lossless", more information [here](https://www.kasmweb.com/docs/latest/how_to/lossless.html#technical-background). In order to use this mode from a non localhost endpoint the HTTPS port on 3001 needs to be used. If using a reverse proxy to port 3000 specific headers will need to be set as outlined [here](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-kasmvnc#lossless).
